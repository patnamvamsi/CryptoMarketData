Gather and store historical and streaming data

Currently, this microservice captures historical tick data for all available coins (Configurable to limit as per requirement).
It can also subscribe and capture streaming live data.

Binance is the current source for both types of data, in future more adapters would be developed to fetch from other exchanges
